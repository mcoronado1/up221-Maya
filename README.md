## ***A Brief Introduction***
Hi! My name is Maya Coronado and I'm a second-year MPH student with a concentration in :seedling: Environmental Health Science :seedling: at the Fielding School of Public Health. My reseach interests include environmental justice, the disproportionate exposure of hazardous materials for vulnerable populations, and equitable solutions for the housing crisis in Los Angeles. Outside of school, I enjoy all things baseball and hope to one day visit all the stadiums! ⚾ ⚾ ⚾

## Potential Project Ideas: ## 
These might change but here's what I'm working with at the moment! 
+ Documenting environmental hazards that the unhoused population faces in various SPAs
+ Examining available greenspace in Low SES as it relates to air pollution, accessibility, and safety

## Personal Class Objectives: ##
+ Visualize data through GIS in a manner that is accessible and digestible to a general audience
+ Learn how to effectively program in Python
+ Utilize urban planning and public data to understand how different populations experience the same environment
