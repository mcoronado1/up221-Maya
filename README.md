## ***A Brief Introduction***
Hi! My name is Maya Coronado and I'm a second-year MPH student with a concentration in :seedling: Environmental Health Science :seedling: at the Fielding School of Public Health. My reseach interests include environmental justice, the disproportionate exposure of hazardous materials for vulnerable populations, and equitable solutions for the housing crisis in Los Angeles. Outside of school, I enjoy all things baseball, going to the movies for an Icee, and reading! 

## Potential Project Ideas: ## 
+ Documenting environmental hazards that the unhoused population faces in various SPAs
+ Examining available greenspace in Low SES as it relates to air pollution, accessibility, and safety
 
## Course Description ##
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed into human expressions and narratives, and how can these be represented spatially? Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address location-based questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways.

## Personal Class Objectives: ##
+ Visualize data through GIS in a manner that is accessible and digestible to a general audience
+ Learn how to effectively program in Python
+ Utilize urban planning and public data to understand how different populations experience the same environment
