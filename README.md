Hi! My name is Maya Coronado and I'm a second-year MPH student with a concentration in :seedling: Enviornmental Health Science :seedling: at the Fielding School of Public Health. My reseach interests include enviornmental justice, the dispropotionate exposure of hazardous materials for vulnerable populations, and equitable solutions for the housing crisis in Los Angeles.
